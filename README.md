## Motivation

We wanted to create a [GraphQL tutorial](https://learn.hasura.io) series. The content would be written by developers for various languages/frameworks and what better than writing it in Markdown! And since this is a tutorial series we also needed rich embeds, syntax highlighting and more customisations.

We also wanted to serve these tutorials in sub paths of [learn.hasura.io](https://learn.hasura.io). To serve all these requirements, we decided to use Gatsby + MDX (Markdown + JSX) to extend markdown and used a neat consistent theme like the one at [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com) and deployed as docker containers.
